Arcade Asteroid [Unity Project]

This is the complete project of Arcade Asteroid made entirely in Unity 4.6 with full Facebook integration (using Facebook SDK 6.2.1).

The basic code (movement, shooting, and basic damage methods) and most of the sprites are from quill18creates (a great youtuber who does excellent unity tutorials). 

After that I took it and added most of the rest of the features that now exist in the project like: 

• Moving in and out of the screen "teleportation" (like you can do in the original asteroid arcade game) 
• Health Points and multiple lives 
• A basic score system
• Full Facebook integration through the Facebook SDK for Unity which includes a highscore system between friends, inviting people to the the game and sharing the application on the player's Facebook Timeline.

I am planning on adding a whole lot of extra features in the near future like: LOTS of different enemies, power ups that can give you different kinds of weapons, health packs and adding actual asteroids :P.

Hope you like it

Use the code as you wish :)
